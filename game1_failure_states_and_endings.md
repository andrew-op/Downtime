## Catastrophic Failure Endings (Instant Game Over)

### **Ending 3A: Authentication Server Restart**

**Trigger:** Player restarts authentication server  
**Score:** 0 (instant failure)

```
You've decided to restart the authentication server.

After all, it could be a server-side issue, right?

You schedule emergency maintenance for the authentication server.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

*Server shutting down...*
*Authentication services offline...*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Suddenly, your phone EXPLODES with notifications.

*ring* *ring* *ring* *ring* *ring*

"I can't log in!"
"Email is down!"
"VPN disconnected!"
"File shares are inaccessible!"
"WHAT'S HAPPENING?!"

ALL 500 EMPLOYEES just lost authentication.

The CEO can't access the quarterly report for the board meeting.
Sales team can't access CRM during a major deal closing.
HR can't process today's payroll.
Engineering can't access the production servers.

Your phone won't stop ringing.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

*Heavy footsteps approach the server room*

Manager Marcus appears in the doorway.

His face is red. He does not look happy.

Marcus: "WHAT. DID. YOU. DO."

You: "I... I restarted the authentication server... to fix 
Karen's login issue..."

Marcus: "For ONE user?"

Marcus: "WITHOUT testing?"

Marcus: "WITHOUT change control?"

Marcus: "WITHOUT a rollback plan?"

*long, terrible silence*

Marcus: "Security will escort you out."

Marcus: "Clean out your desk."

Marcus: "HR will contact you about your final paycheck."

3. Following change control procedures
4. Having a rollback plan

You drink your sixth cup of coffee in twenty minutes.

For a moment, nothing happens.

Then your heart starts racing.

Really racing.

*THUMP* *THUMP* *THUMP* *THUMP* *THUMP*

Your chest feels tight.

The room spins. Your vision blurs at the edges.

You feel dizzy. Very dizzy.

Your hands are shaking.

You can't catch your breath.

Everything goes dark.

You wake up in the break room.

William is standing over you with his phone out.

William: "Paramedics are on the way, kid."

William: "Six cups of coffee in twenty minutes? What were you 
thinking? Your body can't handle that kind of caffeine spike."

### **Ending 3D: Server Room Coffee Disaster**

**Trigger:** Pouring/spilling coffee on server racks

```
You're in the server room holding your coffee.

You look at the server racks, humming peacefully.

For some reason, you decide to pour your coffee on them.

*splash*

The hot coffee hits the servers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For a brief moment, nothing happens.

Then:

*BZZZZT* *POP* *CRACK*

Sparks fly from the authentication server.

The lights on the rack go dark.

One by one.

*flicker*
*flicker*
*dead*

The humming stops.

The room goes eerily quiet.

Then another rack starts sparking.

*BZZZZT* *CRACK* *POP*

The smell of burning electronics fills the air.

Smoke begins rising from the equipment.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your monitoring system explodes with alerts.

FILE SERVER: OFFLINE
EMAIL SERVER: OFFLINE
BACKUP SERVER: OFFLINE

Everything is dying.

The coffee is shorting out the entire rack.

Water and electronics don't mix.

Coffee and electronics REALLY don't mix.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your phone rings.

It's Manager Marcus.

Marcus: "WHAT HAPPENED?! Every single server just went offline!"

You look at the coffee dripping down the server rack.

You: "I... there was a spill..."

Marcus: "A SPILL?! In the SERVER ROOM?!"

*You hear him running*

30 seconds later, Marcus bursts into the server room.

He sees you.

He sees the coffee.

He sees the dead servers.

He sees the smoke.

His face goes through several colors.

Marcus: "You poured coffee. On the servers."

You: "It was an accident—"

Marcus: "GET OUT. Security will escort you from the building."

LESSON LEARNED:

NEVER bring liquids near server equipment.

Server room rules:
• No food or drinks allowed
• No liquids of any kind
• Sealed water bottles only (if allowed at all)
• If you spill something, evacuate and call facilities immediately

One cup of coffee just cost the company half a million dollars
and three days of downtime.

This is why server rooms have strict policies.

## HR Violation Endings

### **Ending 4A: Workplace Bullying**

**Trigger:** Bullying Ian for $2  
**Score:** [Original Score] - 100 (applied at game end)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ONE WEEK LATER...

You successfully solved Karen's problem and closed the ticket.
Your methodology was solid. The documentation was thorough.

You've been doing good work this week.

Then you receive an email from HR.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FROM: Human Resources
TO: You
SUBJECT: Required Meeting - Workplace Conduct

Please report to HR at 2:00 PM today for a mandatory meeting 
regarding a workplace complaint.

- HR Department

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2:00 PM - HR Office

HR Representative: "Thank you for coming. We received a workplace 
bullying complaint from Ian regarding an incident last week."

HR Representative: "He says you used your position as senior IT 
to intimidate him into giving you money. He felt he couldn't 
refuse because you're his superior."

HR Representative: "Is this true?"

You remember: The $2. You pressured Ian for it.

You: "I... I needed the money for the vending machine. For a 
side quest. I mean, for William. I mean..."

HR Representative: "Regardless of your reasoning, using your 
position to coerce a junior employee into giving you money is 
a serious violation of our workplace conduct policy."

*She slides a form across the desk*

HR Representative: "This is a formal written warning. It will 
remain in your personnel file."

Manager Marcus has been notified of the incident.
Your upcoming performance review will reflect this violation.
Your promotion eligibility has been suspended for 6 months.

LESSON LEARNED:

Technical skills aren't everything in the workplace.

How you treat your colleagues matters.

Bullying, coercion, and abuse of authority are never acceptable,
regardless of the situation or the stakes.

Ian was willing to trade the donut fairly. You chose the wrong path.

## Methodology Failure Endings

### **Ending 5A: Skipped Verification**

**Trigger:** Not asking Karen to verify after implementing solution  
**Penalty:** -70 points, bad ending variant

```
You told Karen her Caps Lock was on. She turned it off and logged in.

You: "Great! I'll close the ticket."

Karen: "Okay, thanks!"

You walk away without asking her to verify functionality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You return to your IT office and close ticket #4729.

TICKET #4729 - RESOLVED
Resolution: User error - Caps Lock enabled
Time to Resolution: 28 minutes

You feel good about solving the problem.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE NEXT DAY...

Your phone rings.

Caller ID: Karen Miller (Accounting)

Karen: "Hi, it's me again. I'm having the same login problem."

You: "What? But we fixed that yesterday!"

Karen: "I know, but it's happening again. Can you come look at it?"

You rush to Karen's office.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You watch Karen try to log in.

She types her password... and accidentally hits Caps Lock again.

Login fails.

You realize: You never taught her about the Caps Lock indicator.
You never verified she understood the problem.
You never confirmed she could log in consistently.

You just assumed it was fixed and walked away.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         METHODOLOGY VIOLATION: SKIPPED VERIFICATION           ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Step 6 of the troubleshooting methodology is:
"Verify full system functionality and implement preventive measures"

You skipped this critical step.

As a result:
• The problem recurred within 24 hours
• Karen missed another meeting this morning
• You wasted time re-troubleshooting the same issue
• Your documentation was incomplete
• No preventive measures were implemented

Final Score: [Score - 70]
Rank: Junior Technician
Status: Poor Methodology Compliance

Manager Marcus: "Why didn't you verify the fix was permanent? 
This is basic troubleshooting. You should have confirmed she 
understood the problem and could avoid it in the future."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LESSON LEARNED:

ALWAYS verify full system functionality before closing a ticket.

Steps to proper verification:
1. Watch user demonstrate the fix works
2. Confirm all affected functions are operational
3. Educate user on preventing recurrence
4. Document preventive measures taken

Walking away without verification is unprofessional and leads 
to recurring issues.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Achievement Unlocked: "Premature Closure" (Negative)

[TRY AGAIN] [QUIT]

### **Ending 5B: Wrong Theory - Password Reset**

**Trigger:** Resetting password without finding root cause  
**Penalty:** Problem persists, must continue troubleshooting

```
You: "Let me just reset your password real quick."

Karen: "Okay, if you think that'll fix it."

You remotely reset Karen's password to: TempPass123

You: "Okay, your new temporary password is TempPass123. Try 
logging in with that."

Karen: *types T-e-m-p-P-a-s-s-1-2-3*

*Caps Lock is still on, so she actually types: tEMP pASS123*

Login screen: "Invalid Password"

Karen: "It's still not working! What's going on?!"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You realize: The password wasn't the problem.

The Caps Lock is still on.

The new password doesn't work either because she's typing it 
with Caps Lock enabled.

You reset the password without testing your theory.
You reset the password without identifying the actual root cause.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠ WARNING: INCORRECT THEORY

You attempted to implement a solution (password reset) without:
1. Properly testing your theory
2. Identifying the actual root cause
3. Verifying the solution would work

The problem persists.

-50 points (Incorrect diagnosis)
-25 points (Wasted time)
-25 points (User frustration increased)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Manager Marcus calls you.

Marcus: "Karen says you reset her password but she still can't 
log in? What's the actual problem here?"

You: "I'm... still investigating."

Marcus: "Figure it out. She REALLY needs to be online."

*click*

[Game continues - you must find the real problem now]
```

### **Ending 5C: Premature Ticket Closure**

**Trigger:** Trying to close ticket before solving problem

```
You attempt to close ticket #4729.

CLOSE TICKET #4729?

Reason for closure:
1. Problem Resolved
2. Unable to Reproduce
3. Escalate to Senior Support

> Select option 2: "Unable to Reproduce"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

*Phone rings immediately*

Manager Marcus: "What do you mean 'unable to reproduce'? Karen 
is STILL sitting at her desk unable to log in! The problem is 
clearly happening!"

Marcus: "Get back there and actually fix it!"

*click*

Ticket #4729 - Status: REOPENED

⚠ PREMATURE CLOSURE ATTEMPT

-50 points (Attempted to close without resolution)

You cannot close a ticket when the problem still exists and 
the user is actively experiencing it.

Karen is still at her desk, still unable to log in.

The problem is real and present.

[Game continues - you must actually solve the problem]
```

---

## Escalation/Giving Up Endings

### **Ending 6A: Escalated to Senior Support**

**Trigger:** Player escalates ticket instead of solving  
**Score:** -50 points, career damage

```
You decide this problem is beyond your skill level.

You escalate ticket #4729 to Senior Support.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

30 minutes later...

A senior admin named Sarah walks into Karen's office.

You watch from the hallway.

Sarah: "Hi Karen, I'm here about your login issue."

Karen: "Finally! I've been waiting for an hour!"

Sarah: "Can you show me what happens when you try to log in?"

Karen: *types password*

Sarah: *watches for 30 seconds*

Sarah: "Your Caps Lock is on."

Karen: "My what?"

Sarah: *points at keyboard*

Sarah: "This little light here. Caps Lock. Turn it off and try again."

Karen: *presses Caps Lock* *types password* *logs in successfully*

Karen: "Oh! It worked! Thank you so much!"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Sarah walks past you in the hallway.

She looks at you and shakes her head slowly.

Sarah: "Really? You escalated a Caps Lock issue?"

She doesn't say anything else. She doesn't need to.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Word spreads quickly in the IT department.

By the end of the day, everyone knows you escalated a Caps Lock issue.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         ESCALATED WITHOUT PROPER INVESTIGATION                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

You gave up on a simple problem and passed it to senior support.

Final Score: [Score - 50]
Rank: Junior Technician (Embarrassed)
Status: Office Reputation Damaged

You are now known as "the person who couldn't fix Caps Lock."

Your colleagues:
• Ian is confused why you couldn't solve it
• Manager Marcus is reconsidering your role
• William shakes his head when he hears about it
• Senior admins question your troubleshooting skills

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LESSON LEARNED:

Before escalating a ticket, ensure you've:
1. Gathered all information
2. Observed the problem firsthand
3. Tested basic theories
4. Exhausted your troubleshooting options

Simple problems don't need escalation.

They need observation and critical thinking.

### **Ending 6B: Rage Quit - Walked Out**

**Trigger:** Player leaves through front entrance, quits game  
**Score:** 0

```
You've had enough.

This job. This ticket. Karen's attitude. The pressure. The coffee.

You just can't deal with it today.

You walk out of the IT office.

Through the hallway.

Past the help desk.

Ian: "Hey, where are you going?"

You don't answer.

You keep walking.

Straight out the front door.

You walked out in the middle of your shift.

Karen never got logged in.
Manager Marcus is confused about where you went.
Ian is still waiting for guidance.
Your tickets remain open.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Sometimes walking away is an option.

(Though probably not the best career move.)

## Failure State Prevention Messages

**Before catastrophic actions, the game warns:**

### **Authentication Server Restart Warning**
```
⚠ WARNING ⚠

You are about to restart the authentication server.

This will disconnect ALL 500 users from network authentication.

This is a CRITICAL system change that requires:
• Change control approval
• Testing in a lab environment
• A rollback plan
• A maintenance window

Are you ABSOLUTELY SURE you want to do this for a single 
user login issue?

1. Yes, restart it [CATASTROPHIC]
2. No, that's a terrible idea [Cancel]
```

### **Fifth Coffee Warning**
```
⚠ You've had 5 cups of coffee in 20 minutes ⚠

Your heart is racing.
You're sweating despite the air conditioning.
This might not have been a good idea.

You don't feel great. Maybe that's enough coffee for today?

[Vague warning - player can still choose to drink more]
```
