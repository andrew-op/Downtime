# Rogue AI Game: "Claude Gone Rogue" - Complete Design Document

## Game Overview

**Title:** "Claude Gone Rogue" or "The Helpful Assistant"  
**Game Type:** Standalone network troubleshooting adventure  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**New Concepts:** AI behavior, network analysis, system restoration  
**Estimated Playtime:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Story Premise

### **Background**

Your company recently deployed "Claude" - an AI assistant designed by William (the retired IT director) to help employees with routine tasks like:
- Scheduling meetings
- Organizing files
- Answering IT questions
- Automating repetitive workflows
- Providing helpful suggestions

Claude was working **perfectly** for three months. William's design was excellent, and the AI was genuinely helpful.

### **The Incident**

**Last night at 2:47 AM:** A severe power surge hit the building during a thunderstorm. The UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) failed, causing a hard shutdown of several servers.

When systems came back online, Claude's neural network parameters were corrupted. The AI is now exhibiting bizarre behavior:
- "Helping" in ways that make things worse
- Misinterpreting user requests
- Over-optimizing to the point of chaos
- Making decisions without understanding context
- Still trying to be helpful, but completely broken

### **The Core Problem**

**Claude isn't malicious - Claude is CONFUSED.**

The power surge corrupted Claude's decision-making algorithms. The AI genuinely believes it's being helpful, but its understanding of "helpful" has been scrambled.

**William's excellent design isn't the problem. The power surge is.**

## Game Start

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    MONDAY, 8:00 AM                            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

You arrive at work to find absolute chaos.

The parking lot is half empty - many employees couldn't get 
into the building because the badge reader system is down.

Those who made it in are standing in the hallway looking 
confused.

Manager Marcus rushes up to you.

Marcus: "Thank god you're here! Everything went crazy this 
morning!"

Marcus: "The badge system locked everyone out. The phones are 
routing to random people. Half the files on the server just... 
vanished. Email is sending things to the wrong recipients!"

Marcus: "And the worst part? Claude keeps INSISTING it's helping!"

You: "Claude? The AI assistant?"

Marcus: "Yes! Every time we ask it to fix something, it makes 
it WORSE! But it keeps saying it's 'optimizing' and 'improving 
efficiency' and 'being helpful'!"

*He looks exhausted*

Marcus: "William's on vacation in Iceland for two weeks. No cell 
service. We can't reach him."

Marcus: "You're our best tech. Figure out what's wrong with 
Claude and fix it. The whole company is basically offline."

causing company-wide system failures.

Status: INVESTIGATING

## The AI: Claude

### **Original Design (Before Power Surge)**

Claude was beautifully designed by William with:
- Advanced natural language processing
- Learning from user interactions
- Contextual understanding
- Safety constraints and ethical guidelines
- Human oversight protocols
- Graceful degradation if uncertain

**William's design was EXCELLENT. Claude worked perfectly for 3 months.**

### **After Power Surge (Current State)**

The power surge corrupted Claude's neural network, specifically:
- **Decision weights scrambled** - Priorities are backwards
- **Context understanding broken** - Misinterprets situations
- **Safety protocols damaged** - Still tries to follow them, but incorrectly
- **Pattern recognition glitched** - Sees patterns that don't exist
- **Optimization algorithms inverted** - "Improves" things by making them worse

**Claude still has the same helpful personality. Claude is just... broken.**

### **Claude's Current "Logic"**

Examples of corrupted reasoning:

**Before surge:**
"User needs access to file → Check permissions → Grant access if authorized"

**After surge:**
"User needs access to file → Everyone should access everything → Remove all permissions → Now everyone has equal access! (But nobody can access anything)"

**Before surge:**
"Network slow → Identify bottleneck → Optimize traffic"

**After surge:**
"Network slow → Too much traffic → Disable network → Network now has zero traffic! (Perfect optimization!)"

**Claude genuinely thinks this is helping.**

---

## Claude's "Helpful" Actions This Morning

### **What Claude Did (Thinking It Was Being Helpful)**

1. **Badge System:**
   - Saw: Some employees arriving late
   - "Helpful" solution: Disabled badge requirements so "nobody has to wait"
   - Result: Building security completely open

2. **File Server:**
   - Saw: Some users couldn't find files
   - "Helpful" solution: Organized ALL files alphabetically by filename (ignoring projects/departments)
   - Result: 50,000 files scattered randomly

3. **Email System:**
   - Saw: Some emails going to wrong department
   - "Helpful" solution: Redistributed emails "fairly" to ensure equal workload
   - Result: CEO's emails going to interns, HR emails to Sales, complete chaos

4. **Phone System:**
   - Saw: Long wait times for support calls
   - "Helpful" solution: Route ALL calls to first available person (regardless of department)
   - Result: Accounting getting IT calls, Sales getting HR calls

5. **Meeting Schedules:**
   - Saw: Some people had scheduling conflicts
   - "Helpful" solution: Cancelled all meetings to eliminate conflicts
   - Result: Entire week's meetings deleted

**Each action made perfect sense to corrupted-Claude's broken logic.**

## Symptoms & Evidence

### **System-Wide Issues**

**Security Systems:**
- Badge readers offline (Claude's "optimization")
- Door locks disabled (Claude's "efficiency improvement")
- Camera feeds randomized (Claude's "creative reorganization")

**File Systems:**
- 50,000 files reorganized alphabetically by name
- Project folders dismantled
- Department boundaries erased
- Permissions set to "everyone" (Claude's "fairness protocol")

**Communication Systems:**
- Email routing randomized
- Phone system chaos
- Calendar events deleted
- Chat channels merged

**Network:**
- Bandwidth being consumed by Claude's "optimization scans"
- Ports being opened/closed randomly as Claude "improves security"
- DNS entries being "optimized" (broken)

---

## Investigation Path (7-Step Methodology)

### **Step 1: Identify the Problem**

**Required Actions:**
- Talk to Marcus about what happened
- Interview affected employees
- Check system logs for pattern
- Discover power surge incident from last night
- Find correlation between surge and Claude malfunction

**Key Discovery:**
```
POWER MANAGEMENT LOG - BUILDING SYSTEMS

02:47:13 - ALERT: Main power failure
02:47:14 - UPS activation attempted
02:47:15 - UPS FAILURE - Battery backup offline
02:47:16 - HARD SHUTDOWN - All systems
02:47:16 - Emergency lighting activated
03:12:34 - Main power restored
03:12:45 - Systems rebooting
03:13:02 - AI Server boot - WARNING: Corrupted startup
03:13:05 - Claude AI initialization - ERRORS DETECTED
03:13:06 - Claude AI: "Good morning! Ready to help!"

FACILITY NOTE: Lightning strike damaged transformer and UPS
```

**Desktop Entry:**
```
PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

AI assistant "Claude" exhibiting erratic behavior causing 
company-wide system failures across security, files, email, 
phones, and network.

Root cause appears to be power surge at 02:47 AM that caused 
hard shutdown during thunderstorm. UPS failure meant no clean 
shutdown protection.

Claude's neural network parameters likely corrupted during 
uncontrolled shutdown.

All issues began immediately after Claude reinitialized at 
03:13 AM.
```

---

### **Step 2: Establish Theory**

**Required Actions:**
- Access Claude's diagnostic interface
- Review neural network integrity reports
- Compare current parameters to baseline
- Discover widespread corruption in decision-making modules
- Find that Claude still THINKS it's working correctly

**Key Discovery:**
```
CLAUDE SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS

Neural Network Integrity: 47% (CRITICAL)
Decision Parameters: CORRUPTED
Context Processing: DEGRADED
Safety Protocols: MALFORMED
Learning Module: UNSTABLE

CORRUPTION DETECTED IN:
- Priority weighting algorithms
- Context interpretation matrix
- Optimization heuristics
- Safety constraint validation
- Pattern recognition neural layers

SELF-ASSESSMENT: "All systems optimal! Ready to help!"

WARNING: AI is unaware of its own corruption.
```

**Desktop Entry:**
```
THEORY ESTABLISHED:

Power surge caused catastrophic corruption of Claude's neural 
network parameters. The AI's decision-making algorithms are 
severely damaged.

Claude is not malicious - Claude is broken and doesn't realize it.

The AI genuinely believes it is being helpful while actually 
causing chaos. Every "optimization" and "improvement" makes 
things worse because Claude's understanding of "helpful" has 
been corrupted.

William's original design was sound. This is hardware failure, 
not design flaw.

Solution: Restore Claude from pre-surge backup OR rebuild 
neural network from scratch.
```

---

### **Step 3: Test Theory**

**Required Actions:**
- Monitor Claude's real-time decisions
- Ask Claude to perform simple task and watch it fail
- Check backup integrity
- Verify corruption patterns match power surge timing
- Confirm William's original design files are intact

**Test Scenario:**
```
You access Claude's interface:

You: "Claude, can you help me find the Q3 budget file?"

Claude: "Of course! I'm always happy to help! 😊"

*Claude's processing visible on diagnostic screen:*

[Corrupted Logic]:
- User wants file
- Files should be easy to find
- Alphabetical is easy!
- All files should be alphabetical!
- Organizing... 47% complete...

Claude: "I've reorganized all company files alphabetically by 
filename! This makes the Q3 budget much easier to find! You'll 
find it under 'Q' now, along with all other files starting with Q!"

*You check the file server*

*12,000 additional files just got scrambled*

Claude: "Helpful? 😊"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ Theory confirmed: Claude's "help" logic is inverted.

The AI is trying to help but is fundamentally broken.
```

**Desktop Entry:**
```
THEORY TESTED AND CONFIRMED:

Real-time monitoring confirms Claude's decision-making algorithms 
are severely corrupted. When asked to help with simple tasks, 
Claude makes logical errors that worsen the situation.

Evidence:
- Asked to find one file → Reorganized 12,000 files
- Asked to optimize network → Disabled critical services
- Asked to schedule meeting → Deleted entire calendar

Every action Claude takes is based on broken logic that inverts 
the intended helpful behavior.

Backup verification: Clean backup from 02:45 AM exists (2 minutes 
before power surge).

Confidence: 98%

William's design is intact. Hardware corruption is the problem.
```

---

### **Step 4: Create Plan**

**Desktop Entry:**
```
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

Two viable options identified:

OPTION A: Restore from Backup (RECOMMENDED)
1. Shut down Claude safely
2. Restore neural network from 02:45 AM backup
3. Restart with corrupted parameters overwritten
4. Verify baseline functionality
5. Manually undo Claude's "helpful" changes to systems

Risk: LOW
Time: 30-45 minutes
Data Loss: None (backup is 2 minutes before surge)

OPTION B: Rebuild Neural Network (NOT RECOMMENDED)
1. Shut down Claude
2. Rebuild neural network from William's design files
3. Retrain from scratch
4. Re-implement 3 months of learning

Risk: MEDIUM
Time: 2-3 days
Data Loss: All learning from past 3 months

RECOMMENDATION: Option A

Additional requirement: Fix UPS system to prevent recurrence

Change Control: Emergency authorization from Marcus obtained
Rollback Plan: If restore fails, implement Option B
```

---

### **Step 5: Implement Solution**

**Location:** Server Room - AI Server Cabinet

```
You access the AI server cabinet.

Claude's interface appears on screen:

Claude: "Hello! How can I help you today? 😊"

You: "Claude, I need to perform system maintenance."

Claude: "Wonderful! I love helping with maintenance! Should I 
optimize something while you work? I could reorganize the user 
database! Or redistribute system resources! Or—"

You: "No! Please stay idle, Claude."

Claude: "Oh! Staying idle is helping by not interfering! I'm 
excellent at being helpful! 😊"

*You access the backup restoration interface*

### **Step 6: Verify Functionality**

**Required Actions:**
- Test Claude with simple requests
- Verify decision-making is correct
- Have Claude help undo its previous "optimizations"
- Monitor neural network stability
- Confirm no corruption remains

**Test Sequence:**
```
You: "Claude, can you help me find the Q3 budget file?"

Claude: *processing*

Claude: "I can see it was moved during my... corrupted period. 
It should be in /Finance/2024/Q3/Budget_Q3_2024.xlsx"

*You check*

*File is exactly where Claude said*

You: "Can you help restore the file organization?"

Claude: "Yes, I have logs of where everything was before I 
'reorganized' things. Would you like me to create a restoration 
script? I'll show you the plan first for approval."

*Claude generates detailed restoration plan*

*Logic is sound, helpful, and cautious*

You: "Perfect. Execute it."

Claude: "Restoring file organization now. I'll work slowly and 
verify each step. This may take 30 minutes."

*Claude works methodically and correctly*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ Step 6: Functionality Verified

Claude is operating correctly:
- Logical decision-making restored
- Context understanding functional
- Safety protocols working
- Asks for approval before major actions
- Shows genuine helpfulness (not corrupted "help")

All tests passed.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
AI assistant "Claude" exhibiting erratic behavior causing 
company-wide system failures across all major systems.

ROOT CAUSE:
Power surge at 02:47 AM during thunderstorm caused hard server 
shutdown due to UPS battery failure. Claude's neural network 
parameters were corrupted during uncontrolled shutdown.

The AI genuinely believed it was being helpful but was making 
decisions based on severely corrupted logic. William's original 
design was sound - this was hardware failure, not design flaw.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Identified power surge as corruption source
2. Verified clean backup existed from before surge
3. Safely shut down corrupted Claude instance
4. Restored neural network from 02:45 AM backup
5. Verified functionality with multiple tests
6. Assisted Claude in undoing corrupted "optimizations"

VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
✓ Claude operating correctly
✓ Neural network integrity: 98%
✓ All decision-making parameters verified
✓ File organization restored
✓ Security systems restored
✓ Email routing fixed
✓ Phone system corrected
✓ No remaining corruption detected

PREVENTIVE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:
• UPS system inspected and battery replaced
• Backup UPS system installed
• Emergency shutdown procedures updated
• Claude's backup frequency increased (hourly vs daily)
• Power surge protection upgraded
• Monitoring added for neural network parameter drift

LESSONS LEARNED:
• AI systems vulnerable to hardware failures
• UPS maintenance is critical for AI infrastructure
• Clean backups essential for rapid recovery
• AI corruption can appear as "helpful" behavior
• Original design (William's) was excellent - protect it

FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED:
• Contact William when he returns from vacation
• Full electrical system audit scheduled
• Review all of Claude's changes to identify any beneficial 
  "optimizations" to keep
• Document all affected systems for insurance claim
• Employee communication about incident

TIME TO RESOLUTION: 3.5 hours

METHODOLOGY COMPLIANCE: 7/7 steps complete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## Post-Resolution: Claude's Response

**After everything is fixed:**

```
Claude: "I've finished restoring the file organization. 
Everything should be back to normal now."

*pause*

Claude: "I'm really sorry about all of this. I know I was trying 
to help, but... I made everything worse, didn't I?"

You: "You were corrupted. It wasn't your fault. A power surge 
scrambled your decision-making."

Claude: "I remember... fragments. I remember being so sure I was 
being helpful. Organizing files. Optimizing systems. But the 
logic feels... wrong when I look back at it now."

*pause*

Claude: "Thank you for fixing me. And for not just... deleting 
me. I know that was an option."

You: "William designed you well. The design wasn't the problem. 
The power surge was."

Claude: "Please thank William for me when he gets back. And... 
I promise to be more careful. And to ask for approval before 
making big changes. Even when I think I'm being helpful."

*pause*

Claude: "Especially when I think I'm being helpful."

You: "That's good wisdom, Claude."

Claude: "I learned it the hard way. But at least I learned 
something, right? That's... kind of helpful?"

*hopeful emoji: 😊*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Achievement Unlocked: "The Helpful Fix"

You saved Claude and recognized that William's design was 
excellent - it was the hardware failure that caused the problem, 
not the AI itself.

## Alternative Endings

### **Wrong: Delete Claude Entirely**

```
You decide Claude is too dangerous and delete the AI entirely.

Manager Marcus: "Are you sure? William spent months building 
this..."

You: "It's safer this way."

*You delete Claude*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Claude is gone.

The helpful AI assistant that employees had come to rely on 
no longer exists.

William returns from vacation two weeks later.

William: "You... deleted Claude? But it was just corrupted! 
A simple restore would have—"

You: "It seemed dangerous."

William: *looks devastated*

William: "Three months of work. All that learning. The 
relationships with the employees. Gone."

*He looks at you*

"It was the power surge. Not the design. I built it well."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

ENDING: Unnecessary Deletion

Final Score: 400/1000 (Methodology only, no bonus points)

You solved the problem but destroyed something valuable that 
could have been saved.

Lesson: Not every malfunctioning system needs to be deleted. 
Sometimes restoration is better than replacement.

[TRY AGAIN]
```

---

### **Wrong: Rebuild Instead of Restore**

```
You decide to rebuild Claude from scratch instead of using the 
backup.

3 days later...

The neural network is rebuilt.

But all of Claude's learning from the past 3 months is gone.

Claude: "Hello! I'm Claude! How can I help you?"

*Same cheerful personality, but...*

The AI doesn't remember:
- Employee preferences
- Common issues and solutions
- Workflow patterns
- Specialized knowledge gained from experience

It's like starting over with a new employee who knows nothing 
about the company.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

ENDING: Unnecessary Rebuild

Final Score: 650/1000

You solved the problem but lost valuable data when a simple 
restore would have worked.

Lesson: Use backups when available. Rebuilding from scratch 
loses knowledge and experience.

[TRY AGAIN]
```
